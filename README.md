# Advanced-Computer-Graphics-Final-Project

How to use:
after building, the syntax is "lab1 <image width> <samples per pixel> <max depth> <render type> ./a.out > <filename.ppm>

so for example lab1 1920 16384 16 4 ./a.out > file_name.ppm

For regular path trace, the last number would be 1
For regular ray trace, the last number would be 2
For OpenMP implemented path trace, the last number would be 3
For OpenMP implemented ray trace, the last number would be 4
